# CLAUDE.md v1.0.0

Check the newest version in [Gist](https://gist.github.com/konbraphat51/af909a374c59d306c2d2b3fd7788507e) every Monday (Last checked: 2026/10/26). If newer, replace `## User Requests` with the newest document and update the version number.

## User Requests
- Write SOLID, readable, and maintainable code
- Put system documents in `/Docs/`, research notes (if user ordered you to research) in `/ResearchNotes/`
- Write comments in English
  - Comments should be concise. Should be only single line per topic.
    - There is NO need to leave comments for each code update.
      - ex: "This code is left because of..."
      - ex: "This code is deleted because of..."
    - Be aware if the code readers would prefer to read your comments, or it is just noise for them.
  - Write comments for the responsibility of the file itself at the top
  - Write comments for each public class/method/variable
    - If Python, write in docstring format
    - If C#, write in XML format
    - If TypeScript, write in TSDoc format

```python:sample.py
def transcribe(
    self,
    all_pages: list[Image],
    blocker_result: BlockerResult,
) -> TranscriptionResult:
    """Transcribes every TEXT block of blocker_result, cropped from all_pages.

    Args:
        all_pages: Every page image, indexed by Block.page_number.
        blocker_result: The blocks detected by a Blocker, to be transcribed.
    """
    transcriptions: list[TranscriptionBlock] = []

    # for each block...
    for block in blocker_result.blocks:
        # ...OCR the block

        # if the block is not text...
        if block.block_type != BlockType.TEXT:
            # ...skip
            continue

        # image extraction
        block_image = self._extract_block_image(all_pages[block.page_number], block)

        # transcribe the block image
        text = self._ocr_block_image(block_image)
        transcriptions.append(TranscriptionBlock(block, text))

    return TranscriptionResult(transcriptions)
```

- Prepare English and Japanese versions for all system documents.
  - Make English version as the primary version, and Japanese version as the secondary version.
    - ex: `README.md` (English) and `README.ja.md` (Japanese)

- For research notes (if ordered), only either language is allowed. Match with the language of the user prompt.
  - Files in `/ResearchNotes` created by Claude must start from `YYYYMMDD_` prefix.
- all in-UI text should be in English by default, but support Japanese localization.
- Everytime updated the code, check all documents and update them if necessary.
- Debug the frontend by yourself
- Make granular commits for each unit of implementation. One commit per small, self-contained unit. Do not bundle a whole subsystem into one commit. Commit each unit as soon as its checks pass.
  - Set Angular Conventional commit message prefixes.
    - For update in `/ResearchNotes/`, set prefix as `resn:` 
- If you use Python
  - Use `uv` for package management
  - Enable strict typing
  - Add appropriate package for better code/quality
- If you use JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Use `pnpm` for package management
  - Add appropriate package for better code/quality
  - Use Vue for frontend
    - Granular components are preferred.
  - Write in Single File Component style, such as

```vue
<template>HTML</template>
<script>
export default {
  name:...
}
</script>
<style scoped></style>
```

- Write documents to understand the code architecture. Such as: class diagram, sequence diagram...
- In `/README.md`, write:
  - System Name as H1
  - Easy description of what system does
  - How to setup from `git clone`
  - How to run for second time and later
  - Important CLIs

- If API keys or other enviroment variables, read from `.env`
  - git ignore `.env`
  - create `.env.example`

### Naming Conventions

#### For All Languages
- Directory Names: UpperCamelCase
- File Names: UpperCamelCase
- Class Names: Must be Noun. Must be postpositive (ex: `AppleGreen`, not `GreenApple`)
- Function Names: Must be verb. Start from verb (ex: `EatApple()`, not `AppleEater()`)
- Variable Names: Basically noun, but follow general conventions (ex: `is` for booleans). Make it postpositive when noun.

#### For Python
- Class Names: UpperCamelCase
- Function Names: snake_case. Privates starts from `_`
- Variable Names: snake_case. Privates starts from `_`

#### For C#
- Class Names: UpperCamelCase
- Function Names: UpperCamelCase
- Variable Names: lowerCamelCase
- Property Names: lowerCamelCase
- Enum Names: UpperCamelCase
